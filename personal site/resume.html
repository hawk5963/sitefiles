			<h2 id = "centernormal">Summary</h2>
			<p id = "p1"> My goal for the immediate future is to secure employment in the field of Computer Science at a company where I can bring my unique skill-set and work ethic, while also furthering my own knowledge in the field. My largest pre-college achievement is my attainment of the Eagle Scout Award in April of 2016, a process that greatly improved my leadership skills. </p>
			<h2 id = "centernormal">Education</h2>
			<p id = "p1"> I will be earning my BS in Computer Science from the <a href = "https://www.stthomas.edu/">University of St. Thomas</a> this May, having attained this in only three years, as opposed to the usual four year track. During my time at UST, I learned many different programming languages and how to use many different types of software, applying all of these skills towards in-class projects and otherwise.</p>
			<h2 id = "centernormal">Employment History</h2>
			<p id = "p1"> I interned as a Junior Software Developer at <a href = "https://www.oati.com/">OATI</a> during the summer of 2018. I worked primarily on adding functionality to existing software, fixing bugs, and properly documenting code that others had written.  This entailed learning several new languages such as SQL, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and a proprietary language.  All work was done in sprints, which was an excellent window into the world of Agile and Scrum. </p>
			<h2 id = "centernormal">Hobbies & Interests</h2>
			<p id = "p1">In my free time, I enjoy writing and performing music on guitar, Nordic Skiing, and programming games.</p>
